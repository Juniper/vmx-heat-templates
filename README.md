# ABOUT
Openstack/ contains heat templates to bring up vMX on an openstack installed system. It is applicable to both Redhat and Ubuntu openstack. The system typically consists of 1 controller and 1 or more compute nodes. A switch like a QFX may typically be used to interconnect the openstack nodes. The Getting Started Guide above can be used to configure the systems after basic openstack installation is done on controller and compute nodes. The Heat Template Guide contains actual examples of templates to bring up vMX or interconnect them via topologies.
